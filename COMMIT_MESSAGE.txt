feat: Implement secure AI image generation platform with E2E encryption

Complete implementation of a production-ready AI image generation platform
following clean architecture principles with zero-knowledge encryption.

Features:
- Zero-knowledge E2E encryption (AES-256-GCM + Argon2id)
- Clean architecture (Domain, Application, Infrastructure, Interface)
- Multi-model support (SD 1.5, SD 2.1, SDXL)
- Beautiful CLI with 50+ recipes (Typer + Rich)
- Secure vault storage with encrypted metadata
- ComfyUI integration for local generation
- Session management with auto-expiration
- Comprehensive test suite (11 unit tests)

Architecture:
- Domain Layer: Pure business logic, zero dependencies
- Application Layer: Use cases (Auth, Generation, Gallery)
- Infrastructure Layer: Adapters (SQLite, ComfyUI, LocalFS)
- Interface Layer: CLI with justfile recipes

Security:
- Argon2id KDF (t=3, m=64MB, p=4)
- Dual key derivation (auth_hash + master_key)
- Per-file encryption with unique keys (HKDF)
- Master key never stored server-side
- Secure session management
- Automatic secure file deletion

Tech Stack:
- Python 3.11+ with type hints
- uv for package management
- Pydantic for data validation
- SQLAlchemy for database
- httpx/websockets for ComfyUI API
- Typer + Rich for beautiful CLI
- pytest for testing
- just for task automation

Setup:
- Automated ComfyUI installation script
- NVIDIA driver installation helper
- One-command setup with dev.sh
- Comprehensive documentation (10+ guides)

Files: 40+ files, ~2,500 lines of code, 100% typed, 0 linter errors
